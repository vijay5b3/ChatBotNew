## 📊 Response Examples

### Question: "What is binary search?"

**📚 Detailed Mode (150-250 words):**
```
**Binary Search**

Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding a specific item 
in a sorted list. Think of it like finding a name in a phone book - 
instead of checking every page, you open the book in the middle and 
decide whether to look in the first half or second half...

**Why it's useful:**
It's incredibly fast for large datasets, reducing search time...

**How it works:**
- Start with the middle element of your sorted list
- If it's the target, you're done!
- If target is smaller, search the left half
...

**Key things to remember:**
- Only works on SORTED data
- Much faster than linear search (O(log n) vs O(n))
- Common in databases, file systems, and search algorithms
```

**💡 Simple Mode (50-100 words):**
```
**Definition:** 
Binary search finds items in a sorted list by repeatedly dividing 
the search area in half.

**Simple Explanation:**
It's like finding a word in a dictionary. You open to the middle, 
see if your word comes before or after, then repeat with only that half.

**Key Steps:**
1. Start at the middle of the sorted list
2. Compare with your target value
3. Go left if target is smaller, right if larger
4. Repeat until you find it

**Example:**
Finding 7 in [1,3,5,7,9,11,13]: Check 7 (middle) → Found it in 1 step!
```
